## Course Description: 
This GitHub repository is a collection of the projects in the course, INDE 577: Data Science and Machine Learning, in Rice University. This data science course focuses on the topics in machine learning. The topics covers the algorithms from supervised learning and unsupervised learning. The key feature of this course is that instead of using well-established packages, we build up algorithms from scratch. In this process, we learned all the details of the algorithms including basic concepts, computational steps, model design, and evaluation metrics.

## Repository Description

For this repository, each sub-repository is named by an algorithm name, and it contains a .ipynb file which illustrates and impliments algorithms/applications/visualizations learned in that week, a README file, and sub-repositories of dataset/images files (if applicable).

Programming language used in this repository is Python 3.
