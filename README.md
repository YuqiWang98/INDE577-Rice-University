## Course Description: 
This repository is for code assignments of course INDE577, Data Science and Machine Learning, of Rice University in Spring 2022.This data science course covers algorithms from supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. We will implement many of the machine learning algorithms from scratch, but will also make use of the Skikit-Learn and Tensorflow libraries.
