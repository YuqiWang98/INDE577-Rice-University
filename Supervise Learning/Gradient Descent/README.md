    - Introduction of gradient descent and Algorithm
    - Build the Gradient Descent algorithm from scratch
    - Find a best linear model for a data with 4 data points using the algorithm
    - Perform the Gradient Descent to find a linear regression model to predict the body mass of penguin by the flipper length
    - Compare the built algorithm with the LinearRegression tool from sklearn

## Dataset

Penguins Dataset:

The Penguins Dataset contains size measurements for three penguin species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. These data were collected from 2007 - 2009 by Dr. Kristen Gorman's team. It consists of 344 rows and 7 columns. The three different species of penguins are Chinstrap, Ad√©lie, and Gentoo penguins.
