### Gradient_Descent.ipynb containing:
* Introduction of Gradient Descent
* Implement
* Build the gradient Descent algorithm from scrach
* Find a best linear model for data with 4 data 
* Perform the Gradient Descent to find a linear regression model to predict the body mass of penguin by the flipper length
* Compare the built algorithm with the LinearRegression tool from sklearn

## Dataset
**Penguins Dataset**:

The Penguins Dataset contains size measurements for three penguin species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. These data were collected from 2007 - 2009 by Dr. Kristen Gorman's team. It consists of 344 rows and 7 columns. The three different species of penguins are Chinstrap, Ad√©lie, and Gentoo penguins.
