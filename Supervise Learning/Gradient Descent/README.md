### Gradient_Descent.ipynb containing:
* Introduction of Gradient Descent
* Implement:
* Part 1:
  ** Build the gradient Descent algorithm from scrach
  ** Find a best linear model for data with 4 data 
* Part 2:
  ** Perform the Gradient Descent to find a linear regression model to predict the body mass of penguin by the flipper length
  ** Compare the built algorithm with the LinearRegression tool from sklearn
