### Dataset:
**Penguins Dataset**

The Penguins Dataset contains size measurements for three penguin species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. These data were collected from 2007 - 2009 by Dr. Kristen Gorman's team. It consists of 344 rows and 7 columns. The three different species of penguins are Chinstrap, Adélie, and Gentoo penguins.
