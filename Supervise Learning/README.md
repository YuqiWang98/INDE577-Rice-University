# Supervised Learning

There are nine supervised learning algorithms perfomed in this sub-repository. Most of the algorithms are coded from scratch. Each algorithm is performed in two different datasets, one of which is from the class example.

## Definition  <a class="anchor" id="Definition"></a>
**Supervised learning (SL)**  is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples.It is called supervised learning because the process of an algorithm learning from the training dataset can be thought of as a teacher supervising the learning process. We know the correct answers, the algorithm iteratively makes predictions on the training data and is corrected by the teacher. Learning stops when the algorithm achieves an acceptable level of performance.

## How supervised learning works <a class="anchor" id="supervised"></a>
Supervised learning uses a training set to teach models to yield the desired output. This training dataset includes inputs and correct outputs, which allow the model to learn over time. The algorithm measures its accuracy through the loss function, adjusting until the error has been sufficiently minimized.

Supervised learning problems can be further grouped into regression and classification problems.

**Classification**: A classification problem is when the output variable is a category, such as “red” or “blue” or “disease” and “no disease”.
**Regression**: A regression problem is when the output variable is a real value, such as “dollars” or “weight”.

## Challenges
Although supervised learning can offer businesses advantages, such as deep data insights and improved automation, there are some challenges when building sustainable supervised learning models. The following are some of these challenges:

* Supervised learning models can require certain levels of expertise to structure accurately.
* Training supervised learning models can be very time intensive.
* Datasets can have a higher likelihood of human error, resulting in algorithms learning incorrectly.
* Unlike unsupervised learning models, supervised learning cannot cluster or classify data on its own.
