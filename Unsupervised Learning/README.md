# Introduction
Unsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention. Its ability to discover similarities and differences in information make it the ideal solution for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies, customer segmentation, and image recognition.

# Applications of unsupervised learning
Machine learning techniques have become a common method to improve a product user experience and to test systems for quality assurance. Unsupervised learning provides an exploratory path to view data, allowing businesses to identify patterns in large volumes of data more quickly when compared to manual observation. Some of the most common real-world applications of unsupervised learning are:

* News Sections: Google News uses unsupervised learning to categorize articles on the same story from various online news outlets. For example, the results of a presidential election could be categorized under their label for “US” news.
Computer vision: Unsupervised learning algorithms are used for visual perception tasks, such as object recognition.  
* Medical imaging: Unsupervised machine learning provides essential features to medical imaging devices, such as image detection, classification and segmentation, used in radiology and pathology to diagnose patients quickly and accurately.
Anomaly detection: Unsupervised learning models can comb through large amounts of data and discover atypical data points within a dataset. These anomalies can raise awareness around faulty equipment, human error, or breaches in security.
* Customer personas: Defining customer personas makes it easier to understand common traits and business clients' purchasing habits. Unsupervised learning allows businesses to build better buyer persona profiles, enabling organizations to align their product messaging more appropriately.
* Recommendation Engines: Using past purchase behavior data, unsupervised learning can help to discover data trends that can be used to develop more effective cross-selling strategies. This is used to make relevant add-on recommendations to customers during the checkout process for online retailers.

# Unsupervised vs Superiesd
Unsupervised learning and supervised learning are frequently discussed together. Unlike unsupervised learning algorithms, supervised learning algorithms use labeled data. From that data, it either predicts future outcomes or assigns data to specific categories based on the regression or classification problem that it is trying to solve. While supervised learning algorithms tend to be more accurate than unsupervised learning models, they require upfront human intervention to label the data appropriately. However, these labelled datasets allow supervised learning algorithms to avoid computational complexity as they don’t need a large training set to produce intended outcomes. Common regression and classification techniques are linear and logistic regression, naïve bayes, KNN algorithm, and random forest.
